# Introduction_R
It is R Codes for Introduction to R Programming lectures. 
The video lectures (in mandarin) are available at https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ss411C7gi?p=2&spm_id_from=pageDriver 
Feel free to download, play with, and redistribute these files.  
I would be very happy if people can learn R with the help of my code.
