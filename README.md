# Introduction_R
It is R Codes for Introduction to R Programming lectures. 
The video lectures (in mandarin) are available at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBTcf4SwWEI9_kCOJ-1o-Jwr-_Qb6bkeg  
Feel free to download, play with, and redistribute these files.  
I would be very happy if people can learn R with the help of my code.
